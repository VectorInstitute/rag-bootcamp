# RAG Bootcamp: Web Search

This is a reference implementations for Vector Institute's **RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) Bootcamp**, taking place from Nov 2024 to Jab 2025. Popular LLMs like OpenAI's GPT-4o and Meta's Llama-3 are very good at natural language and sounding like humans, but their knowledge is limited by the data they were trained on. 

In this demo, we attempt to accurately answer open domain factual questions using LLMs by leveraging web search.
