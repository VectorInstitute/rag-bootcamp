# RAG Bootcamp: Document Search

This is a reference implementations for Vector Institute's **RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) Bootcamp**, taking place from Nov 2024 to Jan 2025. Popular LLMs like OpenAI's GPT-4o and Meta's Llama-3 are very good at natural language and sounding like humans, but their knowledge is limited by the data they were trained on. 

In this demo, we use a collection of unstructured documents to answer domain-specific questions, like: *How many AI scholarships did Vector Institute award in 2022?*. We augment a Llama-3 LLM request with an unstructured PDF document search to get the correct answer: **Vector Institute awarded 109 AI scholarships in 2022**

## Requirements

* Python 3.10+
